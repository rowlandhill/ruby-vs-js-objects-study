# Ruby vs. JavaScript: Objects Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and

process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/variables.html)
-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Instance Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/instancevars.html)
-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Local Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/localvars.html)

## Ruby Object Variables: Part I

Assume that we have the following class and an instance of it to work with.

```ruby
class Star
  def initialize(distance_ly, mass_solar)
    @distance_km = distance_ly * 9_460_730_472_580.8
    mass_kg = mass_solar * (1.99 * 10 ** 30)
  end

  def print_distance
    puts "The star is approximately #{@distance_km} kilometers away."
  end

  def print_mass
    puts "The star has a mass of approximately #{mass_kg} kilograms."
  end
end

proxima_centauri = Star.new(4.246, 0.123)
```

Does `proxima_centauri.print_distance` run? Why or why not? If so, then what is
the output? If not, then how can it be fixed?

## Ruby Object Variables: Part II

Does `proxima_centauri.print_mass` run? Why or why not? If so, then what is the
output? If not, then how can it be fixed?

```

## Ruby Object Equality: Part I

Suppose that we have the following block of code.

```ruby
sol = Star.new(0, 1)
the_sun = Star.new(0, 1)
nearest_star = the_sun
```

Will modifying `sol` affect `the_sun`? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Ruby Object Equality: Part II

Will modifying `the_sun` affect `nearest_star`? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## JavaScript Objects

Create an object literal named `vega` with the following properties and values.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| distance | 25.04 |
| solarMass | 2.135 |

```javascript
// your answer here
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript

If, in the above code, `var`, `let`, or `const` were removed and the code were
executed as Ruby code, what type of object will be created?
