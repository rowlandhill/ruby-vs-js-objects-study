## Required Readings

-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/variables.html)
-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Instance Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/instancevars.html)
-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Local Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/localvars.html)

## Ruby Object Variables: Part I

Assume that we have the following class and an instance of it to work with.

```ruby
class Star
  def initialize(distance_ly, mass_solar)
    @distance_km = distance_ly * 9_460_730_472_580.8
    mass_kg = mass_solar * (1.99 * 10 ** 30)
  end

  def print_distance
    puts "The star is approximately #{@distance_km} kilometers away."
  end

  def print_mass
    puts "The star has a mass of approximately #{mass_kg} kilograms."
  end
end

proxima_centauri = Star.new(4.246, 0.123)
```

Does `proxima_centauri.print_distance` run? Why or why not? If so, then what is
the output? If not, then how can it be fixed?

```md
Yes.  It accesses the instance variable @distance_km.  The output is:

The star is approximately 40170261586578.086 kilometers away.
```

## Ruby Object Variables: Part II

Does `proxima_centauri.print_mass` run? Why or why not? If so, then what is the
output? If not, then how can it be fixed?

```md
No.  It attempts to access a local variable called mass_kg that doesn't exist.
One way to fix it is to set mass_kg to an instance variable in the constructor.
```

## Ruby Object Equality: Part I

Suppose that we have the following block of code.

```ruby
sol = Star.new(0, 1)
the_sun = Star.new(0, 1)
nearest_star = the_sun
```

Will modifying `sol` affect `the_sun`? Why or why not?

```md
No.  They are two different objects that happen to have the same attributes.
```

## Ruby Object Equality: Part II

Will modifying `the_sun` affect `nearest_star`? Why or why not?

```md
Yes.  Both variables are referencing the same object.
```

## JavaScript Objects

Create an object literal named `vega` with the following properties and values.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| distance | 25.04 |
| solarMass | 2.135 |

```javascript
const vega = {
  distance: 25.04,
  solarMass: 2.135
};
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript

If, in the above code, `var`, `let`, or `const` were removed and the code were
executed as Ruby code, what type of object will be created?

```md
A hash with the keys "distance" and "solarMass" as symbols.  Their values are
25.04 and 2.135, respectively.
```
